(a) Data Structure  
This is a doubly linked list. Each part stores a number and has two links â€“  
one goes forward to the next part, and the other goes backward to the previous one.

(b) Functions  
- insertAfter: adds a number after a given part.  
- deleteNode: removes a specific part from the list.  
- printList: shows all numbers from start to end.

(c) main()  
We made a list with 10, 20, and 30.  
Then we removed the middle number (20).  
Finally, we printed what was left in the list.

(d) Sample Output  
10 30
