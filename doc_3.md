Documentation for Question 3

(a) Data Structure  
We used a simple linked list where each part stores a number and points to the next part.  
To print it in reverse, we used recursion (a function that calls itself).

(b) Functions  
- insert: adds a new number to the beginning of the list.  
- reversePrint: goes to the end of the list first, then prints while coming back.

(c) main()  
We added three numbers to the list: 30, 20, 10  
Then we used reversePrint to show them in the opposite order.

(d) Sample Output  
Reverse: 10 20 30
